1. Search for 'Customer Related Orders for WooCommerce' in Plugins -> Add New and then click install and activate.
1. Activate the plugin once it's installed.

Navigate to WooCommerce -> Settings and under the General tab you will see the new option added under "Customer Related Orders", the default orders per page is 10, feel free to change this value to something that suits you. Setting the value to "-1" will load all the orders with no pagination - this could slow down the page load time initially!
